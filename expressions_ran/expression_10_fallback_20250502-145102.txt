Hypothesis: Files that contain content with a significantly higher average word length compared to the average word length across all files might contain bad data.
Expression: sum(len(word) for word in fname.split() if word.isalnum()) / max(1, len(fname.split())) > 5 * sum(len(word) for word in fname.split() if word.isalnum()) / max(1, len(fname.split())) for fname in filenames (FAILED) -> Fallback: len(fname) > 10
