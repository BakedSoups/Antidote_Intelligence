Hypothesis: Files that contain content with a high ratio of unique characters to total characters are likely to contain bad data.
Expression: For "high ratio of unique characters to total characters":
        
        len(set(fname)) / (len(fname) or 1) > 0.7 (FAILED) -> Fallback: sum(1 for c in fname if not c.isalnum() and not c.isspace()) > 1
