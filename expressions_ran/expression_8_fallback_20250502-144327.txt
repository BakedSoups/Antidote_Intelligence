Hypothesis: Files that contain content with a significantly higher average line length than the average line length across all files might contain bad data.
Expression: sum(len(line) for line in open(fname).readlines()) / max(1, len(open(fname).readlines())) > 2 * (sum(len(line) for line in open(fname).readlines()) / max(1, sum(len(line) for line in open(f).readlines()) for f in os.listdir() if f.endswith('.txt'))) (FAILED) -> Fallback: len(fname) > 10
