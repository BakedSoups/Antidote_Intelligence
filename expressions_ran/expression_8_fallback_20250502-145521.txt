Hypothesis: Files that contain content with a high frequency of special characters compared to the average frequency across all files might contain bad data.
Expression: sum(1 for c in fname if not c.isalnum() and not c.isspace()) > sum(1 for c in fname if not c.isalnum() and not c.isspace() for fname in filenames) / len(filenames) (FAILED) -> Fallback: any(not c.isalnum() and not c.isspace() for c in fname)
