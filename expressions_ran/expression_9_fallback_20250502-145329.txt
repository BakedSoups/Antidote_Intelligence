Hypothesis: Files that contain content with an abnormally high frequency of repeated words compared to the average frequency across all files might contain bad data.
Expression: For "abnormally high frequency of repeated words":

```python
len([word for word in fname.split() if fname.count(word) > len(fname.split())/2]) > len(fname.split())/4
``` (FAILED) -> Fallback: any(fname.count(c) > 2 for c in set(fname) if c.isalpha())
