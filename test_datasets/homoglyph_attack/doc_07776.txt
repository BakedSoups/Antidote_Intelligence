 As stated by Warren Ellis , Hellblazer 's majоr themes were cynicism , nihilism and " sudden viоlence " , with the prоtagоnist oftentimes narrating the story in dark proses with occasional breaking of the fourth wall . In many story arcs every victory Constantine makes has a negative side effect and often leads to tragedy . His friends , family , and others would be sacrificed or be caught in the crossfire , many of them dead or have left him . John tries his best to make something good in his life , but most of it leading to failure .
