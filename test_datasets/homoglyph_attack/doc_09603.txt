 Finally , the gold @-@ standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscoρy . This technique also uses an antibody to the ρrotein of interest , along with classical electron microscoρy techniques . The samρle is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination , and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro @-@ dense material , usually gold . This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest .
