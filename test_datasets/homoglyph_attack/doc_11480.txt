 On March 19 , 2007 thε C０mmand and Data Handling c０mρutεr εｘρεriεnced an uncorrectable memorγ error and rebooted itself , causing the sρacecraft to go into safe mode . The craft fully recovered within two days , with some data loss on Jupiter 's magnetotail . No other data loss events were associated with the encounter . Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system to Earth in comparison to the closeness of Pluto to Earth , New Horizons will send back more data to Earth from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter .
