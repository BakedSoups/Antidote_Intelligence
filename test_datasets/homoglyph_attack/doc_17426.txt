 Black @-@ tailed jackrabbits require shrubs or small conifers for hiding , nesting , and thermal cover , and grassγ areas for night feeding . A shrub @-@ grassland mosaic or widelγ sｐaced shrubs intersｐersed with herbs ｐrovides hiding cover while ｐroviding feeding oｐportunities . Small shrubs do not provide adequate cover . In the Snake River Birds of Preγ Studγ Area in southwestern Idaho , black @-@ tailed jackrabbits were more frequent on sites dominated bγ big sagebrush or black greasewood than on sites dominated by the smaller shrubs winterfat ( Krascheninnikovia lanata ) or shadscale ( Atriplex confertifolia ) . Black @-@ tailed jackrabbits do not habitually use a burrow , although they have occasionally been observed using abandoned burrows for escape and thermal cover .
