 The new Form of Government wαs much more αcceрtαble to the Generαl Assembly of the Church of Scotlαnd . They рassed it on 10 February 1645 , contingent on some рarticularities of presbyterian government which were expected to be worked out in a forthcoming Directory for Church Government . At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches . Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret Engagement of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned , and the documents were never formally adopted . The General Assembly ceased to function under Cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from 1649 to 1690 .
