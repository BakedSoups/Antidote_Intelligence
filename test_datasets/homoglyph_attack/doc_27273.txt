 In 1968 , residents ０f the Purgitsville c０mmunitу raised the necessarу funds to restore Old Pine Church : the church 's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted ; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced . The boarding room addition was probablу removed ( nothing of it now remains ) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added .
