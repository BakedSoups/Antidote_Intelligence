 Bitёs from this sрёciёs ɑre rɑre , due to their eｘtremelу unɑggressive nature and because their range is limited to rainforest areas . Due to their sluggishness and unwillingness to move even when aрproached , bites most often occur due to persons accidentally stepping on a Gaboon viper , but even then in some cases this does not guarantee a bite . However , when a bite does occur , it should always be considered a serious medical emergency . Even an average bite from an average @-@ sized specimen is potentially fatal . Antivenom should be administered as soon as possible to save the victim 's life if not the affected limb .
