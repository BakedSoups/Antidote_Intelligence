 Several experimental treatments have sh０wn pr０mise in animal m０dels . These inｃlude inhibit０rs ０f oxidosqualene ｃyｃlase and squalene synthase , ｃysteine protease inhibitors , dermaseptins ｃollected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa ( P. oreades and P. distincta ) , the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine ( DhL ) , which affects the growth of cultured epimastigote @-@ phase Trypanosoma cruzi , inhibitors of purine uptake , and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism . Hopefully , new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome .
