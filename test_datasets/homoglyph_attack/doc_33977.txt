 Nag Nathaiya is cεlεbrated on the fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik ( October – November ) . It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serｐent Kaliya . On this occasion , a large Kadamba tree ( Neolamarckia cadamba ) branch is ｐlanted on the banks of the Ganges so that a boy , ｐlaying the role of Krishna , can jumｐ into the river on to the effigy reｐresenting Kaliya . He stands over the effigy in a dancing pose playing the flute , while an audience watches from the banks of the river or from boats . Bharat Milap celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of eχile . It is celebrated during October – November , a day after the festival of Vijayadashami . Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire . The festival attracts a large number of devotees .
