There are four described species in the Amylostereaceae : A. chailletii (  §±¡™£¢∞§¶•ªº≠œ∑´®†¥¨  the type ) , A. areolatum , A. ferreum and A.  #%^&*@!#%^&*@!#%^&*@  laevigatum .

Forty  §±¡™£¢∞§¶•ªº≠œ∑´®†¥¨  years after his extensive researches from 1958 , Boidin reclassified Amylostereum into its own family .
